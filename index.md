# About

Just your average girl on the internet.

..wait, that's what they all say isn't it. Guess I should put something more interesting. I like playing video games, particularly [Flood Escape 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/738339342/FLOOD-ESCAPE-2), and [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/new-horizons/)! As for my hobbies, as i just mentioned I like gaming, but I'm still trying to figure out a lot of things. Hobbies included. I can program, but I'm not sure if I still enjoy and do it enough that it could be considered a hobby. I've also recently taken an interest in drawing! Doesn't mean that I'm good at it though.

Here's some links that you've *probably* seen before:
